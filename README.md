# **Click-to-Color**

A simple JavaScript snippet that changes the background color of a webpage to a random color from a predefined list when the user clicks anywhere on the page.

## **How It Works**
This script dynamically assigns a random background color to the webpage's `<body>` element each time the user clicks on the page. Here's how it works:

1. A list of colors is defined in the script.
2. On each click, the script randomly selects one of the colors from the list.
3. The background color of the `<body>` is updated to the chosen random color.
4. The selected color is logged in the browser's console for reference.

The core functionality is achieved by:
- Listening for click events on the `<body>` element.
- Using `Math.random()` to generate a random index to pick a color from the list.
- Applying the selected color to the `backgroundColor` style of the `<body>`.


## **Suggested Use Cases**
- A fun way to experiment with JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
- A starting point for interactive webpage features.
- Great for teaching and learning JavaScript basics.
